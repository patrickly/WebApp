            Type in the name of the item you're looking for on the search-bar and it will come up (if it's in the database). It has predictive search 
            so if you just type in 'bo', all the items starting with 'bo' will come up in which case 'bottle', 'box' and etc. <br><br>
            You can go ahead just click on which one you want and it will take you to its content page. You can also just click on the item you want on the predictive list.

            Taking a quiz is a good way to test your recycling knowledge. Once you enter the quiz, a picture will be shown and you will 
            choose which bin it belongs to: <b class="font-weight-bold">Compost, Recyclable, or Landfill?</b> <br><br>
            Choosing the right answer will show a green indicator while choosing the wrong answer 
            will show a red indicator. It will give you feedback that tells you the correct answer and why. <br><br>
            After doing all 10 questions you will receive a score of how you did. You will then be prompt to retake the quiz.
