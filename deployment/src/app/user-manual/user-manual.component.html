        Type in the name of the item you're looking for on the search-bar and it will come up (if it's in the
        database). It has predictive search
        so if you just type in 'bo', all the items starting with 'bo' will come up in which case 'bottle', 'box' and
        etc. <br><br>
        You can go ahead just click on which one you want and it will take you to its content page. You can also just
        click on the item you want on the predictive list.
